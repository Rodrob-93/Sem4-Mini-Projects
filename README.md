### Abstract:
Understanding the chemical reactions is difficult. We make use of computer graphics knowledge to make it easier by helping students to imagine the correct way, thereby helping them remember those easily. Here, we present you some basic chemical reactions from 11th and 12th.

## Topic: Carry Look Ahead Adder
### Theory:
    A carry-lookahead adder (CLA) or fast adder is a type of adder used in digital logic. A carry-look ahead adder improves speed by reducing the amount of time required to determine carry bits. It can be contrasted with the simpler, but usually slower, ripple-carry adder (RCA), for which the carry bit is calculated alongside the sum bit, and each stage must wait until the previous carry bit has been calculated to begin calculating its own sum bit and carry bit. The carry-lookahead adder calculates one or more carry bits before the sum, which reduces the wait time to calculate the result of the larger-value bits of the adder.

### Implementation:
#### Components used:
*7 half-adders: 4 to create the look adder circuit, and 3 to evaluate Si and Pi · Ci
*3 OR gates to generate the next level carry Ci+1
*wires to connect
*LED display to obtain the output

#### Pins:
*A0, A1, A2, A3: Pin No. 8 of each HA3, HA2, HA1, HA0 respectively.
*B0, B1, B2, B3: Pin No. 5 of each HA3, HA2, HA1, HA0 respectively.
*B0, B1, B2, B3: Pin No. 4 of each HA0, HA1, HA2, HA3 respectively.
*Cout : ORed output from Pin No. 1 of HA3 & HA6 respectively.
